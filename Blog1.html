                <h1>Eyeonic: An Interview with Founders</h1> <br>
                <p>We introduced you to our exciting new brand, Eyeonic. With their
                    specially-designed fit and exciting, colorful frames, Eyeonic continues to be one of the most
                    distinct styles available on Eyeonic. And the story of Eyeonic and its founders and is nearly as interesting as the variety of frames they offer. We recently sat down
                    with both women to talk more about their time in the eyecare industry.
